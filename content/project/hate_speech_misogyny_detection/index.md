While the exponential growth of **Social Media** such as Twitter and Facebook has permit people to freely express themselves in various forms (text, video, images), these new sources of communication, where anonymity or pseudo-anonymity enables the possibility to afflict a target without being recognized or traced, has led to an increasing propagation of hate speech. Automatic Machine Learning models for the detection of **Hate Speech** could help in preventing or automatically reporting these misbehaviors and consequently reduce the episodes of misogyny, racism, homophobia and cyberbullying. This could be helpful both for protecting individuals’ health and also to monitor public reactions to events.

In order to provide a benchmark for these studies, I have contributed to the organization of the [Automatic Misogyny Identification](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2263/paper009.pdf)(AMI) task at Evalita 2018 in Italian and English language and of the [HatEval](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S19-2007.pdf) task at SemEval 2019 about the detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in Spanish and English messages extracted from Twitter.

In a similar direction, I made some preliminary investigation on the presence of [unintended bias](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3350546.3352512) in machine learning models for **Misogyny Detection**. This can lead the models to recognize positive or neutral texts as hate speech texts only because it contains certain terms (e.g. woman, girl).
