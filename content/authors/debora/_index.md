I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics at Bocconi University](http://www.bidsa.unibocconi.eu/) in the [Bocconi NLP group](https://twitter.com/MilaNLProc). My research interests mainly focus on the detection and counter-acting of hate speech and gender bias which has become fundamental for fighting against several types of discrimination (misogyny, xenophobia, racism, etc.) that subsist in Social Media.

Prior to joining Bocconi University, I spent two years as a PostDoc in Computer Science at the [University of Milano Bicocca](http://www.unimib.it) (Milan, Italy) in the [MIND research laboratory](http://www.mind.disco.unimib.it). My research project "[Deep Learning Representations for Large Attributed Graphs](publication/2019_cage/)" aimed at designing and developing novel Deep Learning unsupervised models for learning a graph representation from large heterogeneous attributed graphs, which comprises both the structure of the graph and the attributes associated with each node.


In 2018, I received my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Milano Bicocca with a thesis titled ["Deep Learning for Feature Representation in Natural Language Processing"](https://boa.unimib.it/handle/10281/241185). My doctoral thesis demonstrated that enhancing Natural Language Processing models with representations obtained by unsupervised Deep Learning models can significantly improve the computational abilities of "making sense" of a large volume of user-generated text. In particular the thesis addresses tasks that were considered crucial for understanding what the text is talking about, by extracting and disambiguating the named entities ([Named Entity Recognition](publication/2018_adapting_named_entity_types) and [Linking](publication/2016_named_entity_linking_italian_tweets)), and which opinion the user is expressing, dealing also with irony ([Sentiment Analysis](publication/2016_deep_learning_sentiment_domain_adaptation/) and [Irony Detection](publication/2016_unsupervised_irony_detection)).
