abstract: "**Hate speech** may take different forms in online social environments.  In this paper, we address the problem of automatic detection of misogynous language on **Italian tweets** by focusing  both on  raw text and stylometric profiles. The proposed exploratory investigation about the adoption of stylometry for enhancing  the recognition capabilities of machine learning models has demonstrated that profiling users can lead to good discrimination of misogynous and not misogynous contents."
