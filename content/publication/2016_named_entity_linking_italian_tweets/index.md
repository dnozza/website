abstract: "This paper describes the framework proposed by the UNIMIB Team for the task of Named Entity Recognition and Linking of Italian tweets (NEEL-IT). The proposed pipeline, which represents an entry level system, is composed of three main steps: (1) Named Entity Recognition using Conditional Random Fields, (2) Named Entity Linking by considering both Supervised and Neural-Network Language models, and (3) NIL clustering by using a graph-based approach."
