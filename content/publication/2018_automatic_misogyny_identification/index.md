abstract: "**Automatic Misogyny Identification** (AMI) is a new **shared task** proposed for the first time at the Evalita 2018 evaluation campaign. The AMI challenge, based on both **Italian and English** tweets, is distinguished into two subtasks, i.e. Subtask A on misogyny identification and Subtask B about misogynistic behaviour categorization and target classification. Regarding the Italian language, we have received a total of 13 runs for Subtask A and 11 runs for Subtask B. Concerning the English language, we received 26 submissions for Subtask A and 23 runs for Subtask B. The participating systems have been distinguished according to the language, counting 6 teams for Italian and 10 teams for English. We present here an overview of the AMI shared task, the datasets, the evaluation methodology, the results obtained by the participants and a discussion of the methodology adopted by the teams. Finally, we draw some conclusions and discuss future work"
